## Part 1: Frontend Demo & Features (0:00 - 2:00)

### Opening (0:00 - 0:15)
"Hello! Welcome to my demonstration of the Othor AI - Mini AI Analyst as a Service platform. I'm excited to show you a complete end-to-end solution that transforms raw CSV data into actionable insights using machine learning. Let me start by showing you the frontend experience."

### Authentication System (0:15 - 0:30)
*[Navigate to localhost:3000]*

"First, let's look at our authentication system. The application starts with a beautiful landing page featuring a modern gradient design. Users can either sign up for a new account or log in with existing credentials. I've implemented JWT-based authentication with secure token management."

*[Demonstrate login process]*

"I'll log in with my test account... and we're authenticated! Notice the smooth transitions and professional UI design using Next.js 14 with Tailwind CSS."

### Navigation & User Experience (0:30 - 0:45)
*[Show navigation menu]*

"The navigation is clean and intuitive - we have Home, Upload, and History sections. The interface is fully responsive and includes loading states, error handling, and toast notifications for better user experience."

### File Upload Interface (0:45 - 1:15)
*[Navigate to Upload page]*

"Now let's upload a CSV file. I've created a drag-and-drop interface with real-time validation. Watch as I upload this sample customer churn dataset..."

*[Drag and drop CSV file]*

"The system validates the file format, size (up to 50MB), and provides immediate feedback. You can see the upload progress, file validation, and schema inference happening in real-time. The interface shows file details like size, number of rows and columns."

*[Show upload success state]*

"Perfect! The file is uploaded and validated. Notice the smooth animations and the clear call-to-action to analyze the data."

### Data Profiling & Visualization (1:15 - 2:00)
*[Click "Analyze Data" button]*

"This takes us to the comprehensive data profiling page. Here's where the magic happens - our system has automatically analyzed the entire dataset and generated professional statistical visualizations."

*[Scroll through profile page]*

"Look at these insights:
- Dataset overview with quality scores and memory usage
- Column-by-column analysis with data types and distributions  
- Interactive charts showing feature correlations
- Data quality assessment with outlier detection
- Missing value analysis and recommendations

The visualizations are built with Recharts and include pie charts, bar charts, correlation matrices, and statistical summaries. This gives data scientists exactly what they need to understand their data quickly."

## Part 2: Backend Architecture & ML Pipeline (2:00 - 5:00)

### Backend Architecture Overview (2:00 - 2:30)
*[Open API documentation at localhost:8001/docs]*

"Now let me show you the robust FastAPI backend that powers all of this. Here's our interactive API documentation - we have comprehensive endpoints covering the entire ML workflow."

*[Navigate through API docs]*

"The architecture includes:
- FastAPI with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- Modular router structure for scalability
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- JWT authentication middleware
- CORS configuration for frontend integration"

### Database Integration (2:30 - 2:45)
*[Show database models and structure]*

"For data persistence, I've implemented a hybrid database approach. The system uses PostgreSQL for production with SQLite fallback for development. We store:
- User authentication data with secure password hashing
- File metadata and processing status
- Model metadata with performance metrics
- Training history and configurations"

### File Upload & Processing Pipeline (2:45 - 3:15)
*[Demonstrate upload endpoint]*

"Let me show you the upload pipeline in action. The `/upload` endpoint handles:
- Streaming file uploads to prevent memory issues with large files
- Real-time schema inference using pandas
- Data type detection (numerical, categorical, datetime, boolean)
- Statistical profiling including null percentages and unique value counts
- Session management with UUID tokens for security"

*[Show backend logs]*

"You can see the processing happening in real-time - file validation, schema inference, and metadata storage."

### Data Profiling Engine (3:15 - 3:45)
*[Demonstrate profile endpoint]*

"The `/profile` endpoint generates comprehensive data analysis:
- Outlier detection using statistical methods
- Correlation analysis between features
- Data quality scoring and issue identification
- Skewness and distribution analysis
- High cardinality and constant column detection"

*[Show profile response]*

"The system returns structured JSON with all statistical insights, which the frontend transforms into those beautiful visualizations we saw earlier."

### ML Training Pipeline (3:45 - 4:30)
*[Navigate to training interface and demonstrate]*

"Now for the core ML functionality. Our training pipeline supports multiple algorithms:
- Random Forest for robust performance
- XGBoost for gradient boosting
- Logistic Regression for interpretability

The system automatically:
- Detects problem type (classification vs regression)
- Handles missing data with intelligent imputation
- Encodes categorical variables
- Splits data with stratification
- Trains models with cross-validation
- Generates comprehensive evaluation metrics"

*[Show training in progress]*

"Watch as I train a Random Forest model on our churn dataset... The system provides real-time feedback and saves the trained model to disk with metadata."

### Model Evaluation & Metrics (4:30 - 5:00)
*[Show training results]*

"Excellent! The model is trained. Look at these comprehensive metrics:
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score for classification
- Feature importance rankings
- Confusion matrix analysis
- Model performance visualization
- Training duration and resource usage"

"The trained model is automatically saved with a unique ID and can be used for future predictions."

## Part 3: Advanced Features & Assignment Alignment (5:00 - 7:30)

### Prediction Interface (5:00 - 5:30)
*[Navigate to prediction page]*

"Let's test our trained model with the prediction interface. I can make both single predictions and batch predictions."

*[Demonstrate single prediction]*

"For single predictions, I'll input customer data... age 35, income $50,000, tenure 24 months... and get an instant prediction with confidence scores."

*[Show prediction results]*

"The system returns the prediction, confidence level, and for classification problems, the probability distribution across classes."

### Batch Prediction Capability (5:30 - 5:45)
*[Demonstrate batch prediction]*

"For batch predictions, I can upload a CSV file with multiple records and get predictions for all of them at once. This is crucial for production use cases."

### Model Management & History (5:45 - 6:00)
*[Show history page]*

"The history page shows all my previous uploads, trained models, and their performance metrics. Users can download trained models in pickle format and track their ML experiments over time."

### Security & Authentication (6:00 - 6:15)
*[Demonstrate security features]*

"Security is paramount - all endpoints are protected with JWT authentication. Users can only access their own data and models. The system includes:
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Token-based authentication
- Session management
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS protection"

### Deployment & DevOps (6:15 - 6:30)
*[Show Docker setup]*

"For deployment, I've containerized the entire application with Docker. The docker-compose setup includes:
- Backend container with FastAPI
- Frontend container with Next.js
- Volume mounting for data persistence
- Health checks and monitoring
- Environment configuration"
